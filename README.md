# Java EE Auction web application
Auction house web application created in Java EE. Developed as part of course MOD250, 'Advanced Software Technologies'.
### Main functionality:
- Authenticated login
- Creating auctions
- Filtering auctions based on search text and category
- Placing bids on auctions
- Giving feedback to auctions you won
- View seller profile
- Overview of your bids
- Overview of your auctions
- Use of HTTPS

### Users
There are two types of users, sellers and customers.
Sellers can create auctions, and customers can bid on them. If a customer wins an auction, he or she can give feedback on the auction.
The sellers rating is calculated based on all feedback it has been given.
In addition, unauthenticated users can view ongoing auctions.

### Authentication
The users are authenticated through a login form based on j_security. The passwords are SHA256 encrypted. 
We have included two generic user logins:
- Seller: username: 'seller', password: 'seller'
- Customer: username: 'customer', password: 'customer'

### REST API
The current active auctions are exposed through a REST API.
JSON and XML are accepted formats. 
```
HTTP GET .../mod250_auction/webresources/auctions/active
```

### SOAP Web Service
The current active auctions are also exposed through a SOAP Web Service.
Supported operations:
```
List<Auction> getActiveAuctions()
```
Returns list of current active auctions.
```
String bidForAuction(Bid newBid)
```
Places a bid on an auction, giving a response message if the bid was successful or not.

### Installation and setup

The project requires:
- Installation of Glasshfish Server v. 4.1.1.
- Setup postgresql database in Netbeans.
- Setup of jdbc authentication realm in Glasshfish. If you're familiar with Glassfish, this should be straight forward. More information can be found here: https://dzone.com/articles/jdbc-realm-and-form-based
